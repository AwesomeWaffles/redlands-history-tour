# Redlands History Tour

## Overview
Imagine a tour of Redlands, without the tour guide! This app points out historic landmarks as you walk (or run) thru town and has a description of its importance and context. We have filters so you can see just the types of landmarks you're intested in (only restaurants, for example). The app runs in the background and will give you a notification when you are within a specified distance of a landmark. Click the notification to see the description, photo, etc.
